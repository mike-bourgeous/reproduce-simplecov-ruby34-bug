      # This uses the midilib gem for MIDI parsing.  Due to limitations in the
      # midilib gem, this does not support MIDI files that change tempo.

      # Also note that track names from midilib might include a trailing NUL
      # ("\x00") byte.  This happens with MIDI files exported from ACID Pro,
      # for example.
